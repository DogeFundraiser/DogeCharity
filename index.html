					<h2>About Doge 4 Water</h2>
					<p>
					Many Dogecoin users receive their first coins from community faucets. Faucets are a way for the community to give back to new comers. We decided to build on top of the idea of giving back to the community. We wondered if we could turn the fun of a faucet into an effort to raise money and awareness for those without clean drinking water.
					</p>
					<p>
					The <strong>Dogecoin Foundation</strong> is working with the wonderful community to help provide water to people in need.
					</p>
					<p>
					As part of our <strong>"Doge 4 Water"</strong> campaign, we're hoping to raise 40 million DOGE by "World Water Day" Saturday March 22, 2014 (to be converted to current value in USD).

					<h2>Tana, Kenya</h2>
					<p>
						Remote, muddy, and perilous. The people of Eastern Kenya walk for miles to pull water from the edge of the Tana river.

			        <p>Eastern Kenyans face some of the harshest conditions that many of us can not even fathom. Wild animal attacks, seasonal draught, not to mention walking miles in the hot sun just to meet their daily water needs.  If this were not bad enough, they  also know that the water is polluted and yet they must have it.  While we can't even begin to solve all of Kenya's problems, we can address the clean water issue.  Thanks to the many generous donors at this years charity: ball, we raised over $800,000 that will go directly towards this crisis.</p>

					<h2>charity:water work in Kenya</h2>

					<p>Kenya is a prized destination for international visitors, but it's also a chronically water-scarce country. A growing population and climate change are contributing to worsening conditions. Measured in cubic meters per person per year, it's projected to have less than a quarter of the water its people need by 2025. </p>

					<p>When surface water is available, like the Tana River County, communities still battle against crocodile attacks and contamination. So we're working with our partners to protect sources and build wells, giving people life- saving access to clean water.</p>

					<p>This program is a continuation of our work with Action Against Hunger (ACF) in Tana River County. We’ll also be expanding water, hygiene and sanitation programs into the West Pokot county of Kenya to reduce the rates of malnutrition among children. </p>

					<p>For this program, ACF will construct new hand-dug wells and rehabilitate broken (non-charity: water) projects. Hand-dug wells are possible in areas with a high water table. Under the supervision of skilled engineers and masons, the community typically contributes time and labor, sometimes digging for up to three months to reach water.</p>

					<p>Improving hygiene and sanitation is just as important as providing access to clean water. To ensure proper hygiene and sanitation training, we’ll form and educate local Water and Sanitation Committees (WASH). These community-led groups will also help maintain and manage the water project.</p>

					<h2>What the 40,000,000 Dogecoin raised will help sponsor</h2>

					<p>Every day, 5,000 kids die from water-related illnesses before they reach their fifth birthday. But it doesn’t have to be that way: drilled wells, spring protections, and BioSand Filters can help provide clean water to communities around the world.</p>
					<p>
						We started this fundraising campaign to help a clean water non-profit organization build projects around the world, and we need your help.
					</p>
					<p>
						Please donate to our campaign -- anything you can give is a huge help.
					</p>
					<p>
						100% of the money will be used to build clean water projects, and when they’re complete, our partner will send us photos and GPS coordinates so we can see the exact community we helped.
					</p>
					<p>
						Once the campaign is funded, our partners will post updates including photos of the completed wells, so we can track their progress.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>The current value of the coins raised will help sponsor:</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Two (2) drilling wells in Kenya</li>
							<li>provide access to water</li>
							<li>provide tools to retrieve and store water</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						We will be converting DOGE to USD before the donation is made.
